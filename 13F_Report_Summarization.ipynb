        "\n",
        "Text summarization is a similar sort of task to machine translation: we have a body of text like a review that we’d like to “translate” into a shorter version that captures the salient features of the input. Accordingly, most Transformer models for summarization adopt the encoder-decoder architecture, although there are some exceptions like the GPT family of models which can also be used for summarization in few-shot settings. The following table lists some popular pretrained models that can be fine-tuned for summarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. GPT-2: Although trained as an auto-regressive language model, you can make GPT-2 generate summaries by appending “TL;DR” at the end of the input text.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. PEGASUS: Uses a pretraining objective to predict masked sentences in multi-sentence texts. This pretraining objective is closer to summarization than vanilla language modeling and scores highly on popular benchmarks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. T5: A universal Transformer architecture that formulates all tasks in a text-to-text framework; e.g., the input format for the model to summarize a document is summarize: ARTICLE.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. mT5: A multilingual version of T5, pretrained on the multilingual Common Crawl corpus (mC4), covering 101 languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. BART:\tA novel Transformer architecture with both an encoder and a decoder stack trained to reconstruct corrupted input that combines the pretraining schemes of BERT and GPT-2.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. mBART-50: A multilingual version of BART, pretrained on 50 languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We’ll focus on mT5, an interesting architecture based on T5 that was pretrained in a text-to-text framework. In T5, every NLP task is formulated in terms of a prompt prefix like summarize: which conditions the model to adapt the generated text to the prompt. As shown in the figure below, this makes T5 extremely versatile, as you can solve many tasks with a single model!\n"
